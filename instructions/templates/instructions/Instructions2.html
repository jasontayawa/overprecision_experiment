    <h2>Sequences:</h2>

    <p>In each sequence, your group will be assigned a color: <span style="color:red">Red</span>
        or <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>. Each color is equally likely to be assigned to your group
        (50-50 chance) and neither you, nor your group members will know the actual color assigned to your group.
        Note that the color in each sequence will be chosen <strong>independently</strong> of the colors in other sequences.</p>

    <p>Your action in each sequence is to guess the probability that the color assigned to your group is
        <span style="color: red">Red</span>. You will make 2 guesses per sequence by answering:</p>

    <p><strong>What do you think is the probability (0-100) % that the color is Red?</strong></p>
    <p>For each sequence, every group member will make their guesses in a randomly determined sequential order.
        The timeline for each set of guesses is as follows:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>When it is your turn, you will first see an indication of what the previous movers in your group have
            done (if you are the first mover, you will see nothing).</li>
        <li>You will then make your first guess (Guess 1) about the probability that the color assigned to the group
            is red based on the indication of the previous movers.</li>
        <li>You will then see a private signal that provides some hint as to your group’s assigned color. You will then
            make your second guess (Guess 2) about the probability that the color assigned to the group is Red based on
            all the information you’ve been given.</li>
    </ol>
