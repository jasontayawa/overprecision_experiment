    <h2>Guesses</h2>
    <h3>Guess 1</h3>
    <p>Before making the first guess (Guess 1), you will be able to see an indication of what other people in your group
        have guessed for this sequence. This indication can be either <span style="color: red">Red</span> or
        <span style="color: blue">Blue</span> and will depend on their second guess (Guess 2). You won’t be shown their
        exact percentage, you will only know if their guesses are above or below 50%. If someone before you guessed
        greater than or equal to 50%, the indication will be <span style="color:red">Red</span>.
        If they guessed less than 50%, the indication will be <span style="color: blue">Blue</span>.</p>
    <h3>Guess 2</h3>
    <p>When you make the second guess, you will also receive a private signal. This signal will take the form of a ball
        drawn from a jar that is assigned to you based on your group’s color. If the group’s color is Red, your ball
        will be drawn from a “Red Jar” and if the group’s color is Blue, the ball will be drawn from a “Blue Jar.”
        Each jar will be composed of 100 balls. The Red jar will have <i>at least 50 Red balls and at most 50 blue balls.</i>
        The Blue jar will have <i>at least 50 blue balls and at most 50 red balls.</i> Details about the jars are given below.
        <strong>Note that your private signals are drawn independently of the signals of other participants</strong>.</p>
