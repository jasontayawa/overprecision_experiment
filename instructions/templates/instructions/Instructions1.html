    <p>Welcome and thank you for taking part in this Economics Experiment. This experiment will last for around 2-2.5
        hours. If you read the instructions carefully, you can earn a considerable amount of money depending on your
        decisions and chance. Your earnings will be paid out to you in cash (venmo) at the end of the experiment.</p>

    <p><i>Before we begin, we ask that you turn off your cell phones for the duration of this experiment. We also ask
        that you do not communicate with anyone for the duration of this experiment and only use the software provided
        to you on your devices. Failure to comply with these rules may result in dismissal from this experiment and you
        will not be paid any earnings you may have otherwise received.</i></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This experiment consists of a series of decision rounds spread out over <strong>5 blocks</strong>. At the
        beginning of each block, you will be <strong>randomly</strong> assigned to a group with 6 participants
        (including you). Neither you, nor your group members will know each otherâ€™s identities.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of each block, you will be assigned a score, from 0 to 10. How the scores are assigned depends
        on the block.</p>

    <p><strong>In Block 1 - </strong>You will be shown the distribution of scores from a sample of people who took part
        in a general knowledge trivia quiz. We will randomly pick a score from this distribution and assign it to you.</p>

    <p><strong>In Blocks 2-5 - </strong>You will first take part in a general knowledge trivia quiz. Each quiz contains
        10 questions. The topics are Geography, Science, History and Entertainment (one quiz per topic). Note that you will
        have 20 seconds per question. Each question requires one to two words to answer (except when otherwise stated).
        <strong>Everyone in your group will take the same quiz per block.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Each block will have 2 phases. Each phase will have 6 sequences.</strong> The procedures for each phase
        are nearly identical, except for the following: In Phase 1, you will not know the score assigned to you.
        In Phase 2, you will be notified about your own score at the start of the first sequence.
        <strong>However, you will never know the score of any of your group members.</strong></p>
