    <h2>Score Guesses</h2>
    <p>In addition to the above, you will make some additional guesses in Blocks 2-5. In Phase 1, after taking the quiz,
        for each score S (from 0 to 10), you will guess the probability that the score is S by answering the following question:</p>
    <p><strong>What do you think is the probability (0-100) % that the score is S?</strong></p>
    <p>You will make 2 sets of these 10 guesses. One set is for your own score on the quiz. The other set is for the
        score of one randomly matched participant in your group who has taken the same quiz. In Phase 2, you will be
        shown your own score and will once again make the same guesses for the randomly matched participant. </p>
    <p>Note that for each set, all probabilities must sum up to 100!</p>
