    <h2>Jars</h2>
    <p>Your private signal is drawn from your individually assigned jar. The composition of each jar is dependent on a
        score (from 0 to 10) that is assigned to you at the beginning of each block. </p>
    <p>A higher score will lead to a higher number of balls of the wrong color being replaced with balls of the right
        color. In other words, higher scores will lead to a higher number of Red balls (and a lower number of Blue balls)
        in the Red jar. Likewise, higher scores will lead to a higher number of Blue balls
        (and a lower number of Red balls) in the Blue jar.</p>
    <p>Each point replaces 5 balls of the wrong color with the right color i.e. in the red jar,
        an additional point replaces 5 blue balls with 5 red balls and vice versa for the blue jar.
        For example, for a score of 7, the red jar contains 85 red balls and 15 blue balls and the blue jar contains
        85 blue balls and 15 red balls.</p>
    <p><strong>Note â€“ You will not know the color of the jar the ball is drawn from. Furthermore, you will not know the
        composition of the jars of other people, nor the color of their jars. Also, a higher score makes it more likely
        for your ball to be the same color as the group.</strong></p>
