    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This experiment has 5 blocks. Each block has 2 phases, and each phase has 6 sequences of guesses.</li>
        <li>The timeline for each block is as follows:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
            <li>First, the computer will randomly assign you into groups of 6.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of each block, you will be assigned a score
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>In Block 1, this score will be randomly assigned based on a distribution of past quiz takers</li>
                <li>In Blocks 2-5, the score will be assigned based on your performance on a quiz at the start of the block</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>Phase 1 starts:
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>For blocks 2-5, we will first ask you to make guesses about your own score</li>
                <li>For blocks 2-5, then we ask you to make guesses about the score of one randomly matched participant in your group.</li>
                <li>After that, you will make 6 sets of two guesses, one for each sequence.</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>Phase 2 starts
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>Your own score, and thus your jar compositions for the block is revealed</li>
                <li>For blocks 2-5, you will again make guesses about the score of one randomly matched participant in your group.</li>
                <li>You will again make 6 sets of two guesses, one for each sequence.</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>Block ends and you move on to the next block.</li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>
