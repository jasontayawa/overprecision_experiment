    <h2>Order of Sequences</h2>
    <p>In the beginning, each of you simultaneously act as the first mover and make guesses in different sequences.
        After everyone makes their guesses as the first mover, you will then randomly move to another sequence and
        follow the first mover of that sequence in making your guesses. When everyone in your group finishes making
        their second set of guesses, you move on to another randomly chosen sequence and make your guesses while
        following the first and second movers of that sequence. This process repeats until all of you in the group
        make your guesses as the 6th mover.</p>
    <p>We repeat this structure twice per block, once for each phase.</p>
    <p>A couple of points to note:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The color assigned to the group remains the same for each mover in a sequence. However, the color assigned
            in one sequence has no impact on the color assigned in another sequence. Knowing the color in one sequence
            does not help you in making your guesses in another sequence</li>
        <li>You will never face the same sequence twice and you will never follow the same person twice â€“ i.e. you
            will make only one set of guesses in a given sequence and at most follow a given person once. Also, you will
            never follow yourself.</li>
    </ol>
