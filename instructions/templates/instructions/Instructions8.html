    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>Your payment will depend on the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your performance on one randomly selected quiz (from blocks 2-4)</li>
        <li>One randomly selected decision of your score for the quiz selected in 1)</li>
        <li>One randomly selected decision of the randomly matched participant’s score for the quiz selected in 1)</li>
        <li>Your two guesses in one randomly selected sequence in blocks 1-5.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For 1) we will pool your quiz score with the scores of people who have previously taken the same quiz.
        Your earnings for your performance on the quiz will be $10 * r where r is your percentile on the quiz.</p>
    <p>For 2 and 3 each, we will randomly select one score S (from 0 to 10). Then we will select a random number Y
        from 0 to 100 (each is equally likely). If Y is less than or equal to your guess for the score’s probability,
        then you will be paid <strong>$2 if the score is S</strong>. Otherwise, you will be paid based on a lottery
        in which you can earn $2 with a chance of Y%.</p>
    <p>Payment for 4 will be similarly determined. Of the 60 total sequences (5 blocks * 2 phases * 6 sequences),
        we will select one sequence at random (each is equally likely). We will then draw two random numbers (Y1 and Y2),
        each from 0 to 100. For Decision 1 for the chosen sequence, if Y1 is less than or equal to your reported guess,
        then you will be paid <strong>$12 if the assigned color is Red.</strong> Otherwise, you will be paid based on a
        lottery in which you can earn $12 with Y1% chance. Payment for Decision 2 is determined identically;
        if Y2 is less than or equal to your reported guess, then you will be paid <strong>$12 if the assigned color is
            Red.</strong> Otherwise, you will be paid based on a lottery in which you can earn $12 with Y2% chance.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: The payment scheme is designed in a way to ensure that the best way to maximize your earnings is to
        report your true guess for the probability. For example, for guesses regarding the color red, you maximize your
        earnings by reporting your true beliefs regarding the probability of Red.</strong></p>
