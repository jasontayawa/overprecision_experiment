        study so that the Researcher may observe your behavior to help gain this understanding</p>

    <h3>Procedures/Tasks:</h3>
    <p>You will be asked to make choices in decision situations using a computer interface. Your payment might depend on
        your decisions, the decisions of other participants or chance. Detailed instructions will be given before the

        society by improving our understanding of decision making.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
    <p>We will work to make sure that no one sees your online responses without approval. But, because we are using the
        Internet, there is a chance that someone could access your online responses without permission. In some cases,
        this information could be used to identify you.</p>
    <p>Also, there may be circumstances where this information must be released.  For example, personal information
        regarding your participation in this study may be disclosed if required by state law.  Also, your records may be
        reviewed by the following groups (as applicable to the research):

            <li>The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board or Office of Responsible Research Practices;</li>
            <li>The sponsor, if any, or agency (including the Food and Drug Administration for FDA-regulated research)
                supporting the study.</li>
        </ul>
        The data generated by the experiment will be kept in password protected and encrypted computer files.
        The data generated by the experiment will be combined with survey questions at the end of experiment.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Research:</h3>
    <p>Your de-identified information may be used or shared with other researchers without your additional
        informed consent. </p>

    <h3>Incentives:</h3>
    <p>At the end of the experiment, you will receive a payment that may depend on your choices, the choices of other
        participants and chance. Your expected payment can range from $15, which includes a $2 participation fee
        which will be given to you even if you decide not to participate.</p>
